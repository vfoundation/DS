A collection of JSON files used to define UI for Jamf's Applications & Custom Settings MDM payload.
Effort has been made to organize preferences either functionally, following the application's documentation structure,
or following the application's UI structure. Payloads are kept as concise as possible to prevent overscroll in Jamf Pro's UI.
